The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant global catastrophe and exposed weaknesses in various domains, including public healthcare systems, supply chains, infrastructures, government responses, etc (Filip et al., 2022).  The medical care services in numerous countries were affected critically due to supply shortages and increasing demands for patient treatments, which challenged the governments and organizations to prevent the spread of the virus and decrease mortality.  

My teammates and I together built machine learning models to predict patients' conditions whether they should be deliveried to ICU and need ventilator or not. We analyzed the demographics of the patients regarding their age and pre-existing medical conditions to discover which age groups and medical problems would contribute severely to the high level of getting infected by the virus. Additionally, we also discover if a patients had respiratory pre-condition(s), would it contribute to a higher likelihood of death for covid patients. This may help hospitals to identify the important factors to prioritize hospitalization and determine whether a patient is allocated to the ICU.
